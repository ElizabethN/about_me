I have 20 years experience in the open source industry, and have positively impacted thousands of people. I care about supporting and developing open source communities, creating a tech culture of diversity, inclusion and empathy, improving the experience of newcomers to tech (especially those from underrepresented backgrounds), leveraging open source for social good, and helping other developers be the best versions of themselves, so that in turn, the tech industry will be a healthier version of itself.  

I've been writing, speaking, leading open source communities, and appearing on podcasts since 2004. 

I am a motivated, high-performing, enthusiastic, and collaborative tech leader who thinks "soft skills" are the hardest skills of all.
