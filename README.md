With over 20 years experience in the open source industry, I have written 3 technical books, given 37 talks, written 52 articles and blog posts,  and appeared on 20 podcasts. While my career started in software development, it evolved into supporting the open source community, community development, creating a diverse tech culture of inclusion and empathy, and helping other developers be the best versions of themselves, so that in turn, the tech industry will be a better version of itself.
