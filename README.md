With over 20 years of experience in open source, I have given 37 talks, written 52 articles and blog posts, published 3 technical books, and appeared on 20 podcasts. My career was originally in software development, but my interests evolved into open source community management, creating a diverse tech culture of inclusion and empathy, and helping those around me be the best versions of themselves, so that the tech industry may be a better version of itself, in turn.
